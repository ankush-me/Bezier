  Done by Sibi Venkatesan (cs184-bf).
  Worked on Ubuntu 12.04 on personal computer[s].
  Checked and submitted from hive14.cs.berkeley.edu

IMPORTANT:
----------
  Running 'make' will not work immediately (sorry!). But cmake will make a Makefile for you.
  Please execute the following commands:

  # If you want:
  mkdir build
  cd build

  # Replace <project_directory> below with appropriate directory.
  # ".." will do if you make build directory in project directory.
  cmake <project_directory>

  # Now you can make the project!
  make

Running the code:
-----------------
  The executable for the code is "dispApp". 
  Assuming you are in the build directory, run the code by typing:

  ./dispApp ../data/teapot.bez 0.01 -a

  or something similar.
